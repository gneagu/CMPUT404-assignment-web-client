Contributors / Licensing
========================

Generally everything is LICENSE'D under the Apache 2 license by Abram Hindle, 
https://github.com/tywtyw2002, and https://github.com/treedust

But the server.py example is derived from the python documentation
examples thus some of the code is Copyright Â© 2001-2013 Python
Software Foundation; All Rights Reserved under the PSF license (GPL
compatible) http://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html

Greg Notes
=========================
I decided to keep the same license as that chosen by Hindle, 
(As licenses generally do not mix well together, and I
do not want to play with that)

-Some code was used as a reference for my code. Links are provided in the
httpclient.py file, but I will provided the here too:
