** User Stories
   - As a user I want to GET from URLs
   - As a user I want to GET from URLs that use virtualhosting
   - As a user I want to POST to URLs
   - As a user I want to POST from URLs that use virtualhosting
   - As a user when I GET or POST I want the result printed to stdout
   - As a developer when I GET or POST I want the result returned as
     a HTTPResponse object

** Requirements
   - [ ] Implement basic HTTP GET
   - [ ] Implement basic HTTP POST
   - [ ] The httpclient can pass all the tests in freetests.py
   - [ ] The webserver can pass all the tests in not-free-tests.py
     (you don't have this one! it can change -- but it will be fair to the user stories/requirements)
   - [ ] HTTP POST can post vars
   - [ ] HTTP POST handles at least Content-Type:
     application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   - [ ] httpclient can handle 404 requests
 

** Recommendations
   - READ the spec, read the format of a request
   - It's a good idea to send the Host header in a GET or POST

** Submission Instructions
   - Fork my repository from github
     https://github.com/abramhindle/CMPUT404-assignment-web-client
   - Push your commits to your fork
   - In EClass for this assignment submit a URL to the git
     repository. I would prefer github for the host.
     - Line 1: the git URL
     - Line 2: Your CCID
